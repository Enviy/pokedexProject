This Pokedex project has been updated to include ascii art of all Pokemon as they're searched. If you're on MacOS, there's also some goofy voice action.

I used the Pok√©API for looking up Pokemon in this project. 
It's pretty neat so if you're interested, check that out over at https://pokeapi.co/

The ascii art code is a reimplementation of the "convert" package developed by Qeesung as a part of "Image2Ascii" over at https://github.com/qeesung/image2ascii

Additional work:
- Add terminal frames to separate areas of Pokedex content. This will better organize the output.
